### Project Scope

### Domain
Pre- and post-purchase product questions (E-commerce) 

The dataset appears to be designed to explore and analyze the relationship between customer and the businesses. The dataset gives us a scope to study the following-
* Customer Behavior Analysis: Understanding how long it takes for customers to have inquiries after making a purchase and identifying patterns or trends in this behavior.
* Customer Satisfaction: Investigating if there's a correlation between the time gap and the nature of the questions, potentially indicating customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
* Product Performance: Analyzing the types of questions for specific products to gain insights into product performance and identify areas for improvement.
* Predictive Modeling: Building models to predict the likelihood of customers asking questions based on the time elapsed since the purchase.

To conclude, the dataset provides valuable information for businesses to understand customer interactions, improve customer support, and gain insights into product-related inquiries over time.

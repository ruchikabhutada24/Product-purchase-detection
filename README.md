**Project Scope**
The machine learning component in this project aims to address a few specific challenges and opportunities within the domain of pre and post-purchase product questions in the e-commerce space. The focus will be on leveraging the dataset from Amazon to gain insights and develop models for the following tasks.

**Objectives**

The dataset appears to be designed to explore and analyze the relationship between customers and businesses. The dataset gives us a scope to study the following-
* Customer Behavior Analysis: Understanding how long it takes for customers to have inquiries after making a purchase and identifying patterns or trends in this behavior.
* Customer Satisfaction: Investigating if there's a correlation between the time gap and the nature of the questions, potentially indicating customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
* Product Performance: Analyzing the types of questions for specific products to gain insights into product performance and identify areas for improvement.
* Predictive Modeling: Building models to predict the likelihood of customers asking questions based on the time elapsed since the purchase.

**Domain**
Pre- and post-purchase product questions (E-commerce) 
**Characteristics:**

Active customer interaction through pre- and post-purchase questions.
Dynamic product catalog with frequent changes.
Varied product-related inquiries.

**Opportunities:**
Insights into customer preferences and satisfaction.
Proactive customer support.
**Specific Task:**

Analyzing temporal patterns in customer inquiries.
Investigating correlations between question types and post-purchase time.
**Stakeholders:**
The major stakeholders for this project would be 
E-commerce platforms
Businesses and sellers
Customers

**Literature Review**
Efficient product categorization is essential to e-commerce success, impacting user experience and purchase decisions.
*1. Need and importance of Product Categorization*

   1.1 Enhances User Experience: Well-structured categorization boosts user satisfaction and conversion rates (Alam et al., 2018).

   1.2 Influences Purchase Decision: Categorization affects consumer decision-making, guiding users towards specific products (Rigas et al., 2017).

*2. Challenges in Product Categorization*

   2.1 Ambiguity and Subjectivity: Ambiguous product attributes and subjective user interpretations pose challenges (Liu et al., 2019).

   2.2 Scalability: Scaling categorization systems for dynamic inventories is a challenge addressed through machine learning (Srivastava et al., 2020).

*3. Emerging Trends*

   3.1 Personalization: AI-driven personalized categorization based on user behavior enhances engagement (Biswas et al., 2019).

   3.2 Cross-Channel Consistency: Maintaining consistent categorization across platforms is crucial for brand image (Lalmas et al., 2017).

*4. Role of Product-Purchase Platforms*

   4.1 Social Commerce Integration: User-generated content and social interactions inform categorization, enhancing the shopping experience (Hajli, 2014).

   4.2 UI Design: Intuitive and visually appealing UIs improve user navigation and comprehension of categorization structures (Yoo et al., 2015).


**Data Source(s)**

Dataset Link: https://registry.opendata.aws/pre-post-purchase-questions/

Amazon S3 bucket ARN: arn:aws:s3:::pre-post-purchase-questions

Text document: https://pre-post-purchase-questions.s3.amazonaws.com/README.txt

Description: This dataset provides product-related questions, including their textual content and gap, in hours, between purchase and posting time. Each question is also associated with related product details, including its id and title.

The specifics described in this dataset involves product-related questions, with each entry providing the following information
* Question: This is the actual content of the question that customers have asked related to a particular product.
* Gap in Hours: This indicates the time gap (in hours) between the purchase of the product and the posting of the question. It gives insights into the duration customers take before reaching out with queries after buying a product.
* Product ID: A unique identifier for each product.
* Product Title: The title or name of the product associated with the question.

**Domain-specific Challenges**

Ambiguity in Product Descriptions: 
Challenge: Figuring out what customers mean in their diverse product-related questions can be tricky due to the sometimes unclear product descriptions.

Dynamic Product Catalog:
Challenge: Products on Amazon change a lot. Adapting our system to always understand the latest products and features is a constant challenge.

**KPIâ€™s**

Time-to-Question Analysis Accuracy: Measures the precision of the model in determining the time gap between purchase and question posting. This is crucial for understanding customer behavior post-purchase.

Customer Behavior Pattern Recognition: Evaluates the model's ability to identify and categorize patterns or trends in customer behavior based on the timing and nature of their questions.

Correlation Identification Accuracy: Assesses the model's effectiveness in identifying correlations between the time gap after purchase and the nature of questions, which may indicate customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction levels.

Product Inquiry Categorization Accuracy: Measures how accurately the model categorizes the types of product-related inquiries, providing insights into product performance and customer concerns.

Predictive Model Accuracy: Evaluates the precision and reliability of predictive models in forecasting the likelihood of customers asking questions based on the elapsed time since purchase.

Dynamic Catalog Adaptability: Assesses how effectively the model adapts to the constantly changing product catalog on Amazon, maintaining high accuracy in understanding and categorizing new products and features.

Ambiguity Resolution Efficiency: Measures the model's capability to decipher and correctly interpret ambiguous product descriptions in customer questions.

Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI): Based on the analysis of question types and timings, derive a CSI to gauge overall customer satisfaction with the product.

Product Improvement Insights: Track how effectively the analysis leads to actionable insights for product improvement.

Customer Engagement Rate: Monitor the rate and depth of customer engagement as indicated by the frequency and nature of questions.

Model Responsiveness: Measure the time taken by the model to adapt to new data or changes in product catalogs.

Feedback Loop Effectiveness: The model's ability to learn from new data and improve over time in terms of accuracy and adaptability.

## Phase2 Deliverable

**S3 Data Storage:**
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a highly scalable and secure object storage solution which is Amazon S3 (Simple Storage solution). We make use of this service to store our dataset before preprocessing it and applying transformations on the same.
2. S3 is advantageous as it lets you store and access any volume of data at any time, it's the perfect option for hosting big datasets, including data about products.
3. S3 is used  to group data into buckets, which are named within the S3 namespace and are globally unique, the link that stores our dataset is s3://pre-post-purchase-questions/.
4.This is the link we use as input to perform the next steps as documented below.
5.S3 is flexible for a product study project since it can store a variety of data kinds, including text files, photos, and metadata.
6. It allows you to regulate who can access your information with fine-grained access controls.
7. Versioning and logging are two capabilities that S3 offers that help you keep track of changes and keep an eye on who has access to your dataset over time.
8. S3 objects may be retrieved using a distinct URL, which makes it easier to integrate them with analytic software and machine learning techniques.

**Data Exploration:**

Athena - 
We make use of AWS Glue for ETL Transformations


**Pre-processing** 

1. Stop words removal
2. convert text to lowercase
3. Tokenization - textbreakdown
4. Extract single item_name clearly

**Data Transformations - AWS Glue**

1. Number of questions for each product
2. Calculate average gap in hours for different product categories or titles.
3. Compute descriptive statistics for the gap in hours, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to understand the central tendency and variability.
